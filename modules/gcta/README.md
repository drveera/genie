To install genie in iPSYCH cluster, follow the instruction in the main page (here). 

If you have followed the instruction in the main page, by now you will have your own conda environment to activate. So first activate the environment by, 

```
source /com/extra/Anaconda-Python/LATEST/load.sh
source activate genie
```

So now, if you type `genie -h `, you will see the main help message. 

Now type, `genie gcta -h`, to see all the submodules under gcta module. To know the options for any of the submodules, for example bivariate, type `genie gcta bivariate -h`. 

The help message should self explanatory.
